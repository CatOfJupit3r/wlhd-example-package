# Data JSONs

This directory contains the JSON files that are used to generate the data for the website. 
The JSON files are generated by toPreset method of each individual class.

## Structure


```
- entities.json
- items.json
- spells.json
- statusEffects.json
- weapons.json
- specialty_trees.json
```

## Usage

This directory is loaded into ContextProvider for Hooks (which is usually the DLCManager).
That data then is used when creating new entities, items, spells, status effects etc.

However, entities JSONs are also used when GMs are creating new GAME PRESET (which are not added here).
Also, specialty trees are used when creating new characters and not directly used for the game.
